v_1.0
1. intpol: user does not need to guess a melting point. See “intpol”.
2. adj_bmix: let SLUSCHI decide the value of BMIX.
3. Bug fixes and various improvements.

v_1.1
1. Bug fixes in AdjustBMIX
2. When installing, copy autojob_cont and StartJob to ~/bin
3. Add thmexp_cnvg thmexp_max thmexp_min tag: user can specify the criterion for convergence of thermal expansion. 
4. Add thmexp_only tag: calculate thermal expansion only.
5. Add thmexp_liq tag: calculate thermal expansion for liquid.
6. "volsearch" now calculates avg energy (can be used to calculate heat of fusion).
7. LongWT: skip the queue
8. diff.f90: add "11"/"10": possibly solid/liquid
9. UpdateJob: generate "jobs_status.out": a summary of each MD (Temp,Iter,nMD,Sure,Solid)
10. Aggressive mode: 

v_1.2
1. Improvement in identifying solid/liquid (diff.f90)
2. Heat of fusion calculations: average and standard error using block average. (avg_std.f90)
3. Improvement and bug fixes in launching MD samples (NextJob.f90)

v_1.3
1. Add feature to detect failed VASP jobs and restart them (in autojob). It takes hundreds of VASP MD runs to calculate a melting temperature, while some jobs may accidentally fail (e.g., running beyond walltime limit, failed to start due to queue/disk/network issue, etc.). Now SLUSCHI checks VASP MD runs and restarts failed jobs.
2. Improvement in "Block Average" method (avg & std) for fusion enthalpy calculations (avg_std.f90)
3. Bug fixes and various improvements (BoldJob, coexrun, NextJob.f90, volsearch, volsearch_cont)
